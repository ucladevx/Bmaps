This has been *deprecated*. Please continue developing locally. We found that frontend/backend development processes were distinct enough and that enabling fullstack local development required too many manual/hacky changes to the frontend to accept API calls to localhost rather than the deployed backend API. 

## How to Develop Locally
- To run just the [backend](https://github.com/ucladevx/Mappening-Backend) or just the [frontend](https://github.com/ucladevx/Mappening-Frontend) locally check out their individual repositories
- To run both backend and frontend together
  - Enter the dev repository
    - `cd Mappening-Deployment/dev`
  - Build and run containers
    - `make run`
